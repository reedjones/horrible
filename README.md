# The Horrible Manifesto ðŸ˜ˆ

If you want your list to be included on `horrible`, make a request! 

**What is horrible?** _(Besides a rip-off of [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome))_ 

## Horrible is Horrible.

No research is necessary to declare something as being horrible. It is an emotional response. When something is horrible you just kind of know. Only put items on the list that have personally affected you. It's better to include too much information than too little.


## Horrible badge

This badge is for Horrible lists.

Add a horrible badge to the top of your list next to the title. 

*The badges can be modified in any way.*



## Comment on why something is horrible

Try, to the best of your abilities, to inform your readers *why* it is horrible. The best is approach is perhaps a narrative, tell a story. Who knows, maybe someone will listen and become inspired to go out and improve the world - or just write better software. 


## Make it clear what the list is about

Have a description at the top of your readme. 
Link to other horrible lists if you think they already cover a certain subject well enough.


## Choose an *inappropriate* license

Because **intellectual property rights are horrible**. 

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) are perfect for this purpose. **We would recommend [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).** 


## Include contribution guidelines

People who are contributing to your list should have a clear understanding of how they should do so.

If you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our [contributing.md](contributing.md) and modify it to your own needs.


## Accept other people's opinion

Because if you don't - you're horrible. 

## DO NOT MAKE HORRIBLE LISTS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

Horrible lists are about horrible technology like apps, software platforms, etc.. - and a little ranting about the companies behind them. Horrible lists **are not about attacking people** - that would be horrible!
