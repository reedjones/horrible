Horrible Lists

# The horrible manifesto

If you want your list to be included on `horrible`, make a request! 

But **what is horrible?** (besides a rip-off of the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) project) 

## Horrible is horrible.

no research is necessary to declare something as horrible - it is an emotional response. when something is horrible you just know. Only put stuff on the list that has personally affected you. It's better to include too much info than too little.

## Horrible badge

This badge is for Horrible lists.


![horrible](https://img.shields.io/badge/horrible-horrible-red)


Add a horrible badge to the top of your list next to the title. 

*The badges can be modified in any way.*


## Comment on why something is horrible

Try, to the best of your abilities, to inform your readers *why* it is horrible. The best is approach is perhaps a narrative, tell a story. Who knows, maybe someone will listen and become inspired to go out and improve the world - or just write better software. 

## Make it clear what the list is about

Have a description at the top of your readme. 
Link to other horrible lists if you think they already cover a certain subject well enough.

## Choose an *inappropriate* license

Because **intellectual property rights are horrible**. 

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) are perfect for this purpose. **We would recommend [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).** 

## Include contribution guidelines

People who are contributing to your list should have a clear understanding of how they should do so.

If you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our [contributing.md](contributing.md) and modify it to your own needs.

## Accept other people's opinion

Because if you don't - you're horrible.
